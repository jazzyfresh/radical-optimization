The Journey Begins...
=====================
## 2017 10 27

There was a time when I was not properly taking care of myself.
I mean that holistically: I was neglecting my body, and consequently, my mind as well.
I think that change is possible within the human psyche, and I am determined to gather
the data to prove it.


Lessons learned so far...
-------------------------

1. Get your house in order and your garden will bloom
2. If you truly understand the components and the context, you can build systems with high probabilities of success
3. People are also systems of (we hope) equal exchange
4. Focus on one thing at a time
5. Build systems and routines that will prevent you from repeating the same mistakes
